# Python-learning
#### _This repository is used to store my python learning jupyter notebooks_.

## Prerequistes

    * Python > 3
    * virtualenv
    * jupyter
    * Patience :)
## Steps
    * Python should be installed and the it should be set so that it could easily accessed from command line
    * Create a virtual env by the following command
        `virtualenv environmentnam`
      This would create an isolated environment which we would use to install the lib's we need

    * Install the necessary libraries and init Jupyter notebook inside the virtual environment.
      This would provide a beautiful interface in which we can write our python programs.It creates an
      isolated kernel using Ipython.
